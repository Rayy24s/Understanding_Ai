                    <p>The financial cost of AI is often underestimated<p>
                    <p>While companies such as OpenAI and Nvidia report record growth, the scale of spending is unprecedented.<p>
                    <p>Open AI’s CEO Sam Altman has stated that OpenAI’s revenues exceeded $13bn in 2025. And it would be remiss to not also mention that OpenAI in particular is burning money just as quickly.<p>
                    <p>Reports indicate that Microsoft had made funding commitments to OpenAI of approximately $13bn in which the majority has already been funded.<p>
                    <p>These same disclosures report also that OpenAI lost $12bn in the last quarter.<p>
                    <p> Meanwhile, AI-related stocks now represent a substantial share of major stock market according to the bank of England “AI stocks now account for roughly 44% of the S&P market capitalisation” meaning the gambling mindset tech companies are operating with in this current market will almost certainly fall on the everyday investors if the situation goes awry.<p>

                    <p>The phrase “AI Arms Race” reflects intense competition between technology companies and increasingly between nations to develop the most advanced systems.<p>
                    <p>This competition serves two primary goals:  keep investors happy and continue to secure market dominance.<p>
                    <p> However, AI technologies are also being integrated into military systems. Autonomous drones capable of identifying and striking targets with the touch of a button raises ethical and legal questions. If the system makes an error who bears the responsibility the developer, the operator or the deploying state?<p>
                    <p>Similar concerns arise with self-driving cars get into accidents.  Tesla’s self-driving models have caused over 41 fatal crashes in the past decade, stressing that as automation expands into high-stakes domains, accountability frameworks must evolve alongside it.<p>
