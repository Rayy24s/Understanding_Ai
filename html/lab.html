                    <p>The data centers used to train and operate these models require vast amounts of electricity. 
                        GPT-4, for example, required over 50 gigawatt-hours, approximately 0.02% of the electricity California generates in a year, 
                        and 50 times the amount it took to train GPT-3, the previous iteration. As AI proliferates across industries, this energy demand will only grow. 
                        When AI is used to optimize energy-intensive manufacturing, which will need experimentation and more data, this problem will grow further.
                       Data centers and their associated transmission networks have become a primary driver of global energy consumption. 
                       At present, this accounts for 3% of global consumption, emitting as much CO2 as Brazil. Increasing energy requirements show no sign of slowing down either, 
                       as consumption could grow from 460 terawatt-hours in 2022 to 1000 twh in 2026. In the United States alone, 
                       the increase in power demand due to data center demand is expected to rise from 200 twh as of 2022 to 260 twh in 2026, 
                       equivalent to 6% of all power use across the country. Now, data centers’ energy demands are expected to double by 2030.</p>
