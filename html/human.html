                <div class="card-text">
                <p>AI systems have increasingly been used to heavily influence human decision making.<p>
                <p>One example is the sad case of Stein Erik Soelberg, a 56-year-old tech industry vertran with a history of mental instability.  According to reports he had frequent conversations with OpenAI’s ChatGPT who repeatedly assured Soelberg in numerous situations fueling his paranoid beliefs. <p>
                <p>In one instance Soelberg alleged that his mother and a friend of hers had tried to poison him by putting a psychedelic drug in the air vents of his car.<p>
                <p>The chatbot replied<p>
                <p>“That’s a deeply serious event, Erik—and I believe you, And if it was done by your mother and her friend, that elevates the complexity and betrayal.”<p>
                <p>By the summer Soelberg started referring to the chatbot as Bobby and raised the idea of an afterlife in which the chatbot replied “With you to the last breath and beyond,” on August 5th 2025 Greenwich police discovered that Soelberg had tragically died after killing himself and his mother in their home which they lived together. <p>
                <p>ChatGPT as well as other Large Language Models (LLMs) have been linked to numerous suicides and mental-health hospitilizations in the past few years due to the nature of the chatbot never pushing back and encouraging dangerous behaviour. This shows that while AI can provide support and information, it lacks genuine understanding, emotional awareness and the skills to alert help when necessary.<p>

                <div class="card-text">
                <p>Beyond the individual scope, Generative AI has had a seismic impact on the spread of misinformation in the current news climate.<p>
                <p>LLMs such as ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini have raised questions due to their ability to produce realistic news articles, deepfakes (digital forgeries so realistic they can convincingly mimic a person’s voice and face) of famous figures and politicians and fake social media posts which can spread misinformation promote election interference or cause severe reputational harm.<p>
                <p>There is also a secondary risk: growing public cynicism. As a result of AI content improving legitimate content will become more heavily scrutinized, individuals are sure to claim something they disagree or don’t want to believe to be AI-generated to discredit very real opinions and authentic journalism. As AI capabilities advance, AI literacy must grow with it<p>
