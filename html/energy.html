                    <p>Water is a foundational pillar of human development and planetary stability.<p>

                    <p>Yet 2.2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water. At the same time, water-hungry extractive industries, water demanding electricity generation plants and increasingly thirsty data centres have put even more pressure on strained resources. Data centres accounted for around 1% to  2% of global electricity demand in 2020.<p>

                    <p> All of the power being generated must be cooled and while some companies have experimented with using cool air on mountain sites others turn to water-based cooling methods further increasing water consumption. <p>
                    
                    <p>In 2014, the amount of electricity being used to cool systems roughly equal to the amount necessary to power the system approximately 194 terawatt-hours which is comparable to the annual energy consumption of Argentina. This highlights a wider issue that technological expansion problem often prioritizes growth and profit over environmental sustainability. <p>

                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is unable to exist without energy.<p>
                    
                    <p> Specifically, large amounts of electricity and these demands are met by data centres which use huge amounts of electricity.  Impact regions which house data centres such as Dallas Texas experience disproportionately high energy demand. In Ireland, data centres consume around 20% of metered electricity supply and in the Virginia, USA, that figure grows to 25% this not only puts strain on resources but increases cost and lowers supply for people living in those regions. <p>
                    
                    <p>Researchers have also discovered that training large-scale frontier AI models like xAI’s Grok 4 when put in a simulation that operates with data on maximum training power, the total electricity consumption can reach numbers of 310 Gigawatt-hours enough to power 70,000 homes in the UK. And while in total these AI models represent a small fraction of global electricity use overall the demand in impact regions raises sustainability issues and infrastructure concerns.<p>
